def row_swap(A, b, p, q):
    """
    Swap two rows in a linear system of equations in place.

    This function swaps the rows `p` and `q` of the coefficient matrix `A`
    and the right-hand side vector `b` for a linear system of equations
    of the form ``Ax = b``. The operation is performed **in place**, modifying
    the input arrays directly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : numpy.ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array of shape ``(n, n)`` representing the coefficient matrix
        of the linear system.
    b : numpy.ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array of shape ``(n, 1)`` representing the right-hand side
        vector of the system.
    p : int
        The index of the first row to swap. Must satisfy ``0 <= p < n``.
    q : int
        The index of the second row to swap. Must satisfy ``0 <= q < n``.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        This function modifies `A` and `b` directly and does not return
        anything.

def row_scale(A, b, p, k):
    """
    Scale a row of a linear system by a constant factor in place.

    This function multiplies all entries in row `p` of the coefficient matrix
    `A` and the corresponding entry in the right-hand side vector `b` by a
    scalar `k`. The operation is performed **in place**, modifying the input
    arrays directly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : numpy.ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array of shape ``(n, n)`` representing the coefficient matrix
        of the linear system.
    b : numpy.ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array of shape ``(n, 1)`` representing the right-hand side
        vector of the system.
    p : int
        The index of the row to scale. Must satisfy ``0 <= p < n``.
    k : float
        The scalar multiplier applied to the entire row.

def row_add(A, b, p, k, q):
    """
    Perform an in-place row addition operation on a linear system.

    This function applies the elementary row operation:

    ``row_p ← row_p + k * row_q``

    where `row_p` and `row_q` are rows in the coefficient matrix `A` and the
    right-hand side vector `b`. It updates the entries of `A` and `b`
    **in place**, directly modifying the original data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : numpy.ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array of shape ``(n, n)`` representing the coefficient matrix
        of the linear system.
    b : numpy.ndarray

    p : int
        The index of the row to be updated (destination row). Must satisfy
        ``0 <= p < n``.
    k : float
        The scalar multiplier applied to `row_q` before adding it to `row_p`.

def gaussian_elimination(A, b, verbose=False):
    """
    Perform Gaussian elimination to reduce a linear system to upper triangular
    form.

    This function performs **forward elimination** to transform the coefficient
    matrix `A` into an upper triangular matrix, while applying the same
    operations to the right-hand side vector `b`. This is the first step in
    solving a linear system of equations of the form ``Ax = b`` using Gaussian
    elimination.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : numpy.ndarray
        A 2D NumPy array of shape ``(n, n)`` representing the coefficient matrix

    verbose : bool, optional
